## Welcome to my new home

I am so excited i can barely stand it…..a NEW HOME for my blog, my store, the archived videos…..everything in one place! Whoo hoo!

We still have some things to tweek and polish but for the most part it is good to go…. so grab a cup of your favorite beverage and feel free to explore.

We weren’t able to port over your purchase history just yet, so if you want to purchase something in the store, you will have to open a new account. You ONLY NEED to open an account to log in if you are purchasing something. Everything is fully accessible without logging in.

The videos are available in the same format they have been….we will be working to organize and make them easier to find very soon.

I hope you all are excited as I am!! In honor of the opening of the new site, I will be giving away a Spring Fairy House kit. Stay tuned for more details tomorrow….

PS:  Pssst! The Spring Fairy House is in the Shop under the Reservations tab…..a fronted enginner

Here's an overview of some of them.
